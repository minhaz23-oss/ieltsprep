The app uses a **freemium model** with:
1. **Generous free tier** - Users can practice extensively
2. **Value demonstration** - Show what's locked with blurred previews
3. **Strategic gates** - Lock advanced analytics, not core practice
4. **Clear CTAs** - "Upgrade to Premium" buttons everywhere locked features appear
5. **Social proof** - Testimonials on pricing page

This strategy lets users experience the platform's value before committing to premium! 🚀
