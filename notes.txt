 1. Implement a Subscription/Premium User Model

  First and foremost, you need a way to distinguish between free and premium users.

   * User Schema: Update your user model in the database (e.g., Firestore) to include a field like subscriptionTier (free | premium) or
     isPremium (boolean).
   * Auth Hook: Modify the useAuth hook (lib/hooks/useAuth.ts) to expose the user's subscription status. This will make it easy to
     conditionally render components and restrict access across your app.
   * Payment Integration: You will need to integrate a payment provider like Stripe or Lemon Squeezy. When a user successfully pays, you'll
     update their user model to reflect their premium status. The Upgrade to Premium button on the pricing page should trigger this payment
     flow.

  2. Restrict or Implement Premium Features

  Here is a breakdown of the necessary changes for each premium feature:

  üé§ Full Speaking Practice & AI Evaluation:
   * Current Status: Free users are explicitly denied speaking practice.
   * To-Do:
       * In app/(practice)/exercise/speaking/page.tsx, use your modified useAuth hook to check if the user is premium.
       * If the user is not premium, block access. You can show a modal or a notice (like your AuthNotice component) prompting them to
         upgrade. The SpeakingTicketModal component suggests you might already have a system for this. You'll need to ensure free users have
         zero tickets.


‚Ñπ Update successful! The new version will be used on your next run.

  üìù Complete Mock Tests:
   * Current Status: Free users are not allowed to take full mock tests.
   * To-Do:
       * On the app/(practice)/mock-test/page.tsx page, check for premium status.
       * If the user is free, either redirect them or display a "Premium Only" message, encouraging them to upgrade.

  ü§ñ Advanced/Unlimited AI Feedback:
   * Current Status: Free users get limited AI feedback detail.
   * To-Do:
       * In your backend API routes (app/api/evaluate-writing/route.ts and app/api/evaluate-speaking/route.ts), you need to implement logic
         to differentiate feedback detail.
       * When a request comes in, check the user's subscription status.
       * For free users, return a basic or truncated version of the AI analysis.
       * For premium users, return the full, detailed analysis.

  üìÑ Detailed Performance Reports & Advanced Study Plans:
   * Current Status: The free plan offers a basic "Progress Dashboard" and "Performance Analytics".
   * To-Do:
       * On the app/(root)/dashboard/page.tsx, create two different views.
       * Free View: The existing dashboard.
       * Premium View: An enhanced dashboard with more detailed charts, in-depth analytics on strengths/weaknesses, and a new "Advanced
         Study Plan" section. This will be a new component you need to build.

  üí° Expert Tips & Strategies:
   * Current Status: A tips-resources page exists.
   * To-Do:
       * In app/(root)/tips-resources/page.tsx, you can implement a content restriction.
       * Allow free users to see a few introductory articles.
       * Lock the majority of the content (especially "Expert Tips") for premium users only. Display a call-to-action to upgrade to view the
         rest.

  üìö Offline Practice Materials:
   * Current Status: This feature does not exist.
   * To-Do:
       * You need to create a mechanism for users to download practice content.
       * On the relevant practice pages (e.g., Reading, Listening), add a "Download for Offline" button that is only visible to premium
         users.
       * This button could trigger a download of the associated JSON and audio/image files from your /public directory.

  üèÖ Certificate of Completion:
   * Current Status: This feature does not exist.
   * To-Do:
       * Define the criteria for earning a certificate (e.g., completing a certain number of mock tests with a specific average score).
       * Create a new page or a section in the dashboard where a premium user can view and download their certificate.
       * You will need to create a certificate template (this could be an HTML/CSS page or a generated PDF) and populate it with the user's
         name and achievement.

  By implementing these changes, you will have a fully functional premium subscription model that aligns with the features you've
  advertised. Let me know if you want to start implementing any of these, and I can help with the code.
