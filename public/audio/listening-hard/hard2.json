  "transcript": "The Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary intervention has precipitated unintended consequences across multiple sectors. Quantitative easing measures, initially designed to stimulate aggregate demand, have paradoxically exacerbated income inequality disparities. Asset price inflation has disproportionately benefited high-net-worth individuals while eroding purchasing power among middle-income demographics. Furthermore, the velocity of money has declined precipitously, undermining the efficacy of traditional transmission mechanisms. Policymakers must reconsider their theoretical frameworks, particularly regarding liquidity trap dynamics and their long-term ramifications for macroeconomic stability.",
