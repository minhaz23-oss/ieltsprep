Classes are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 PM in the library's computer lab, which accommodates sixteen participants per session. The program is entirely free, funded by a government grant for senior education initiatives. Participants must attend at least five of the six sessions to receive a completion certificate. Registration opens on the first Monday of each month and typically fills within forty-eight hours due to high demand.
