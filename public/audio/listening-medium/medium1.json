The research involves analyzing traffic data from twelve major cities including London, Tokyo, and Sydney. Participants are required to complete a detailed questionnaire about their daily commuting habits, preferred modes of transport, and travel expenses. The survey takes approximately twenty-five minutes to complete and offers a fifty-dollar compensation upon completion. Data collection will continue until the end of November, with preliminary findings expected to be published in the Journal of Urban Studies by March next year. Students interested in participating should register online using their university email address.",
