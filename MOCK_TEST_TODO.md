## üî® TODO - Integration Work

### 1. **Integrate Actual Test Components**
Currently all section pages show placeholder "Integration Pending" UIs. Need to:

#### A. Listening Section Integration
- **File**: `app/(practice)/mock-test/[id]/listening/page.tsx`
- **Task**: Replace placeholder with actual `ListeningTest` component
- **What to do**:
  - Import your existing `ListeningTest` component
  - Pass `testId` from `listeningTestId` state
  - Connect the component's completion callback to `handleTestComplete`
  - Ensure answers are captured and sent to API

#### B. Reading Section Integration
- **File**: `app/(practice)/mock-test/[id]/reading/page.tsx`
- **Task**: Replace placeholder with actual `ReadingTest` component
- **What to do**:
  - Import your existing `ReadingTest` component
  - Pass `testId` from `readingTestId` state
  - Connect the component's completion callback to `handleTestComplete`
  - Ensure answers are captured and sent to API

#### C. Writing Section Integration
- **File**: `app/(practice)/mock-test/[id]/writing/page.tsx`
- **Task**: Replace placeholder with actual `WritingTest` component
- **What to do**:
  - Import your existing `WritingTest` component
  - Pass `testId` from `writingTestId` state
  - Capture both Task 1 and Task 2 responses
  - Send responses to AI for evaluation (get band scores)
  - Connect completion callback to `handleTestComplete`

#### D. Speaking Section Integration
- **File**: `app/(practice)/mock-test/[id]/speaking/page.tsx`
- **Task**: Replace placeholder with VAPI integration
- **What to do**:
  - Import VAPI SDK/component
  - Use `speakingTestId` (VAPI Assistant ID) to start call
  - Record call ID and transcript
  - Get band score from VAPI or your AI evaluation
  - Connect completion callback to `handleTestComplete`

### 2. **Enhanced Results Page**
- **File**: `app/(practice)/mock-test/[id]/results/page.tsx`
- **Optional enhancements**:
  - Show detailed breakdown for each section (e.g., which questions wrong in L/R)
  - Display writing Task 1/Task 2 responses with AI feedback
  - Show speaking transcript with feedback
  - Add performance graphs/charts
  - Export results as PDF
  - Share results functionality

### 3. **Session Management Improvements**
- **Files**: Various API routes
- **Tasks**:
  - Add session timeout logic (auto-fail if user leaves for too long)
  - Add pause/resume functionality with timer preservation
  - Handle browser refresh gracefully (save progress periodically)
  - Add "Exit Test" functionality with confirmation

### 4. **Timer Implementation**
- **All section pages need timers**
- **What to do**:
  - Add countdown timer for each section
  - Auto-submit when time runs out
  - Show warnings (e.g., 5 minutes remaining)
  - Store time spent on each section

### 5. **Answer Review Page** (Optional but useful)
- **New page**: `/mock-test/[id]/review`
- **What to do**:
  - Show all questions with user's answers
  - Highlight correct/incorrect answers (for L/R)
  - Show explanations for answers
  - Compare user's writing/speaking with model answers

### 6. **Mock Test History Page**
- **New page**: `/mock-test/history` or `/dashboard`
- **What to do**:
  - List all completed mock tests
  - Show score trends over time
  - Performance analytics (strengths/weaknesses)
  - Progress tracking toward target band score

### 7. **Firestore Security Rules Refinement**
- **File**: Firestore Rules in Firebase Console
- **Current**: Basic rules in place
- **TODO**:
  - Add rules to prevent session tampering
  - Ensure users can only access their own sessions
  - Add rate limiting for session creation
  - Validate data structure on write

### 8. **Testing & Bug Fixes**
- Test complete flow from start to finish with real components
- Test resume functionality thoroughly
- Test with different user types (free vs premium)
- Test error handling (network failures, timeout, etc.)
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser testing

### 9. **UI/UX Polish**
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Better error messages for users
- Add animations/transitions for better UX
- Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Add help tooltips/instructions throughout

### 10. **Analytics & Tracking**
- Track mock test starts
- Track completion rates
- Track drop-off points
- Track average scores
- Track time spent per section

## üö® Known Issues to Fix

1. **Session state bug**: When session has `currentSection: null` but `status: in_progress`, it breaks resume. (Already fixed in code, but existing sessions in DB need cleanup)
2. **Browser back button**: Navigating back during test might cause issues
3. **Multiple tabs**: User opening test in multiple tabs could cause conflicts

## üìù Nice-to-Have Features

1. **Practice Mode**: Allow users to practice individual sections without full test
2. **Custom Mock Tests**: Let users create custom tests by selecting specific L/R/W tests
3. **Leaderboard**: Show top scores (with user consent)
4. **Study Reminders**: Email/notifications to remind users to practice
5. **Mock Test Scheduling**: Let users schedule tests for specific times
6. **Mock Test Bundles**: Group related tests (e.g., "Beginner Bundle")
7. **AI Tutor Integration**: Personalized recommendations based on results

## üîë Priority Order

**HIGH PRIORITY** (Must do):
1. Integrate actual test components (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking)
2. Add timers to all sections
3. Fix session state bug in existing Firestore sessions
4. Test complete flow end-to-end

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Should do):
5. Enhanced results page with detailed feedback
6. Session management improvements
7. Mock test history/dashboard
8. UI/UX polish

**LOW PRIORITY** (Nice to have):
9. Answer review page
10. Analytics & tracking
11. Nice-to-have features

## üìû Integration Notes

### Data Flow
```
1. User clicks "Start Test" ‚Üí Create session in Firestore
2. Navigate to /mock-test/[id]/listening
3. Load actual test component with testId
4. User completes test ‚Üí Send results to API
5. API saves results, calculates band score
6. Show transition screen
7. Navigate to next section
8. Repeat for all 4 sections
9. After speaking ‚Üí Calculate overall band score
10. Mark session as completed
11. Redirect to results page
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/mock-tests` - List all tests
- `GET /api/mock-tests/[id]` - Get single test + user's session
- `POST /api/mock-tests/create-session` - Create new session
- `POST /api/mock-tests/save-section` - Save section results

### Firestore Structure
```
mockTests/{testId}
  - title, description, isPremium
  - sections: { listening, reading, writing, speaking }

mockTestSessions/{sessionId}
  - userId, mockTestId
  - status: 'in_progress' | 'completed'
  - currentSection: 'listening' | 'reading' | 'writing' | 'speaking' | null
  - sectionResults: { listening, reading, writing, speaking }
  - overallBandScore
  - createdAt, updatedAt, completedAt
```

Good luck with the remaining work! The skeleton is solid. üöÄ
