        "transcript": "The double-slit experiment's contemporary iteration utilizing quantum entanglement principles has produced paradoxical results defying conventional interpretation. Photon behavior exhibits non-locality characteristics that transcend Einstein's relativity constraints, suggesting fundamental revisions to space-time conceptualizations. The measurement problem remains unresolved, with decoherence theory failing to adequately explain observed phenomena. Dr. Singh's apparatus demonstrates quantum superposition persistence at macroscopic scales previously thought impossible. These findings potentially revolutionize quantum computing applications while raising profound philosophical questions about the nature of reality and consciousness's role in physical processes.",
